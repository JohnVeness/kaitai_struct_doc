== Primitive type mapping

Mapping KS types to C++ is pretty straight-forward:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==========================
|`type` |C++ type
|no type |std::string
|`u1` |uint8_t
|`u2` |uint16_t
|`u4` |uint32_t
|`u8` |uint64_t
|`s1` |int8_t
|`s2` |int16_t
|`s4` |int32_t
|`s8` |int64_t
|`str`, `strz` |std::string
|==========================

Note that both byte arrays and strings are mapped to `std::string` —
that's because when we store byte array, we need something that would be
able to both hold the byte buffer _and_ store it's length (or at least
able to derive it).

=== String encoding

There's no universal agreement on dealing with encodings in C++, so KS
allows you to choose one of the few popular approaches. You can choose
how to deal with string encoding using a compile-time define.

* `KS_STR_ENCODING_NONE`: Ignore encodings at all. In this mode, all string parsing operations
just ignore any encoding specifications and pass raw bytes as a string
to application. Note that in some cases it might _break_ some .ksy files
that actually depend on string being properly decoded / converted.
* Convert all incoming byte streams into strings in a single,
one-size-fits-all encoding (for example, UTF8, as suggested by
http://utf8everywhere.org/[UTF8 Everywhere Manifesto]).
Since there's no universal way to do it, KS would use one of
platform-dependent ways (which can be also enforced by specifying
specific defines):
** `KS_STR_ENCODING_ICONV`: Use POSIX `iconv` library — usually preinstalled (or included in libc)
on all POSIX systems, can be linked as external library on most other
systems (i.e. Windows)
** *(not implemented yet)* Use Windows API functions
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd319072.aspx[MultiByteToWideChar]
and
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374130.aspx[WideCharToMultiByte]
— obviously, available only on Windows platform
** *(not implemented yet)* Use http://site.icu-project.org/[ICU] library

== Null values

In certain cases, namely when using `if` with an expression that will be
false, a certain attribute won't be parsed. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
seq:
  - id: foo
    type: u1
  - id: bar
    type: u1
    if: foo == 42
----

If `foo` is not 42, then an unsigned 1-byte integer `bar` won't be
parsed. By general convention, Kaitai Struct makes sure that `bar` is
equal to a `null` value, to be able to distinguish such a situation (as
opposed to having some value). However, it's not possible to do so for
many primitive (non-reference) types in C++. In the example above, `bar`
will have type `uint8_t`, and assigning `null` to it would just set it
to 0, thus we won't be able to distinguish a situation when `bar` was
read and we've got 0, and `bar` wasn't read.

To work around this situation, Kaitai Struct generates special null
checking methods for every attribute that can be null:
`_is_null_ATTRIBUTE`, where `ATTRIBUTE` is the name of the attribute.
Thus, the proper way to use such nullable values is something like:

[source,cpp]
----
if (!r->_is_null_bar()) {
    uint8_t bar = r->bar();
    // `bar` is defined, use `bar` here
} else {
    // `bar` is null because of failed `if` comparison
    // note that accessing r->bar() will return an uninitialized value
    // (i.e. random garbage)
}
----
